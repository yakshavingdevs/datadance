# Contributing

>First off, thank you for considering contributing. Find below some of the ways you can contribute.

### Ways you can contribute

1. Have questions or ideas or want to discuss the future of this project, please [start a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/yakshavingdevs/datadance/discussions/new/choose).

2. Did you find a bug or want to create a feature request or found missing documentation? [Create an issue](https://github.com/yakshavingdevs/datadance/issues/new). We only rely on [GitHub's default labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#about-default-labels) for managing all our issues, so adding appropriate labels from that list helps everyone contribute more effectively.

3. Want to fix a bug, add a new feature or fix missing documentation? Go ahead and [create a pull request](https://github.com/yakshavingdevs/datadance/compare). Making sure you reference an issue helps us understand what you are trying to solve.

## Code review process

All Yak Shaving Devs' projects are reviewed by the [project maintainers.](https://github.com/orgs/yakshavingdevs/people)

We know how much effort you invest into a pull request, so we try and review most pull requests within 2 weeks but most of our maintainers currently are working professionals who are doing this as a hobby, so we can't promise a strict turn around time but we promise, we will try our best.

## Ground Rules

2 rules that really help us maintain our projects with more ease:

1. All open ended stuff goes into discussions and anything specific that can be resolved goes into issues.

2. No one likes getting a pull request declined, so make sure that there is an associated issue and no one else is already working on that issue. If you have started working on an issue, please make sure you add a comment on the issue mentioning the same. For any reason, if you are no longer able to work on the issue, also mention that.

## Code of Conduct

Also, please do read our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow it to help us foster a lovely community of developers collaborating together on the coolest stuff. Thank you. üòÅ

## Community

All our community discussion is currently hosted only on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/yakshavingdevs/datadance/discussions/new/choose), so feel free to participate there.
